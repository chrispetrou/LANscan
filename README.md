# LANscan [![GPLv3 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/chrispetrou/LANscan/blob/master/LICENSE)

**LANscan** is a _perl_ script that detects and gathers basic information for every device on the LAN. What is interesting about this tool is that it **doesn't** require elevated-privileges to be able gather those information. The way it works is simple. At first it runs an _un-privileged_ nmap arp-scan which only provides the "active" IPs on the network. Then it dumps the ARP-cache, obtaining this way the corresponding mac-addresses and then making a request to [macvendors.co](https://macvendors.co/api) API, it gathers the mac-address vendor if possible. `LANscan` has been successfully tested on both _macOS_ and _linux_ operating systems and should also be able to be used on _windows_.
